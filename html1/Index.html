<h3>Facts about earth</h3>
<p>Earth receives between 100 and 300 metric ton of cosmic dust (the dust which exists in outer space, as well as all over planet Earth) every day</p>
<p>some other estimates suggest that the incoming dust could be as low as 5 metric ton per day.</p>
<p> Despite the fact that the earth is made up of more than 70% of water</p>
<p>do not be surprised to learn that water accounts for less than 1% of Earthâ€™s mass.</p>
